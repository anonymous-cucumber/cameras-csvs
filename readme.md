# Cameras CSVs

This is a public repository to store CSVs files of cameras, scrapped and aggregated by Cameras Scrapper.  
Cameras Scrapper is a project, stored in [this repo](https://github.com/anonymous-cucumber/cameras-scrapper), to scrap and aggregate cameras positions.

There is two folders :
 - `scraps/` : All cameras "scrapped", or "exported" from other existing online sources, like camerci.fr or "surveillance under surveillance"
 - `dumps/` : All cameras dumped from aggregated camera scrapper databases. A file is a complete dump of all cameras aggregated at a time with cameras scrapper
